Purpose: This program will prompt the user to enter a number
between 1 and 100.  Then the program will try to guess the
user's value, and the user will tell the computer whether
its guess is higher or lower than the user's chosen value
(the user shouldn't lie about this). The program halts when 
the computer player guesses the number the user chosen or 
after the computer player has guessed unsuccessfully 10 times.
