Purpose: This program is a simple number guessing game.
The program will select a number between 1 and 100, and
the user will input a guess into the console to try to
guess the number the program selected.  After the user guesses 
a number, the program will let the user know whether or not
the correct number is higher or lower than the user chosen
value.  The program halts when the user has guessed the 
number selected by the computer and will output the number 
of tries it took the user to guess the number, or when the
user has tried to guess the number 10 times and failed.

	PURPOSE: Checks if the user's guess is equal to the program's random number.  
	This function will let the user know whether the correct number is higher or lower than the guessed value.
	After the user has guessed the correct number, this function will output the number of tries the user took to guess to correct number.
	Alternatively, if the user has guessed 10 times and failed, the program will tell the user he/she has failed, and end the program.
